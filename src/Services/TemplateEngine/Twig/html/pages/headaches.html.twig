                        Migraines are usually on one side of the head.
                        They may be associated with nausea or vomiting and light or sound sensitivity.
                        You might have an aura or a warning signal that a migraine is starting.

                        This type of headache is typically related to injury to the muscles and tissues in the back of the neck.
                        This type of headache usually starts in the neck, shoulders or back of the head. It may extend over the top of the head.
                        Neck movement or positioning can make the pain worse.

                        Sometimes medicines used to treat headaches can lead to rebound headaches.
                        If you take pain medicines on a regular basis, missing a dose can lead to a headache.
                        Even over-the-counter medications can cause rebound headaches if taken frequently.
